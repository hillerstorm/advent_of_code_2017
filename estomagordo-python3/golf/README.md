In which I aim to post shortened solutions to as many challenges as possible.

The intent is to keep the code as short as possible, "golfed", see [Code Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

The one being that, at least for the time being, all solutions will read text files, the same text files that the ordinary solutions use.

That is, a golfed solution to challenge 10a would use the text file `input_10.txt`, rather than a one character long file name, or something altogether different. This may change in an upcoming version, if there is enough time.

Results so far:

1a.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 253 to 96 chars, or 37.94% of the original.

1b.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 256 to 103 chars, or 40.23% of the original.

4a.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 207 to 78 chars, or 37.68% of the original.

4b.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 241 to 103 chars, or 42.74% of the original.

9a.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 678 to 181 chars, or 26.7% of the original.

9b.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 548 to 153 chars, or 27.92% of the original.

12a.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 810 to 309 chars, or 38.15% of the original.
17a.py
Golfed result EQUALS the regular result. The solution was shortened from 270 to 93 chars, or 34.44% of the original.
